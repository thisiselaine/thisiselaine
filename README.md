- 👋 Hi, I'm Elaine (or @thisiselaine)!
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computer-related. 
Computer networks, cybersecurity, software development, GIS, etc.
But I'm also interdisciplinary and hope to learn more about civil and mechanical engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science at the George Washington University. 
In my free time, I love reading and writing, going on runs, and playing and creating music.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects you may have. I'm all for learning!
- 📫 You can contact me at elainely@gwu.edu.
